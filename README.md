# ARM.addArrays
First use of arrays in ARM assembly. Create three arrays. Create one by inserting values directly into the code, a second by filling half of the array in the code with the second half of the array being filled by user inputs, and the third array being the sum of array1 and array2. Then, print the arrays using a BL call to a subroutine.
